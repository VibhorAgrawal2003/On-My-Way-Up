Welcome to "On My Way Up" - a vertical platformer browser game currently in development. Take control of a Frog as you navigate past obstacles of various shapes, sizes, and functions to reach the top where your friend awaits. Along your ascent, encounter diverse platforms and interactive objects such as trampolines for extra height, fans that propel you away, and spikes to avoid.
