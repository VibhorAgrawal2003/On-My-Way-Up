# On My Way Up

"On My Way Up" is a browser game currently in development. In this vertical platformer game, you control a Frog
and leap past obstacles of various shapes, sizes and functions to reach the top where your friend is waiting for
you. On your way up, you will come across various kinds of platforms and objects to interact with such as trampolines
that let you jump higher, fans that push you away from them and spikes that you must avoid.
